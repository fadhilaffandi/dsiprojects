## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement:
ACT has gained traction in the US as an examination alongside SATs. With the introduction of a new format in the SATs in March 2016 we wish to see its impact on states and understand their preferences and their performances over the two exams. 

### Objective:

### Conclusion and Recommendation:
Previously ACTs gained traction due to the format of the exam being more 'straight-forward' and does not have a penalty system to their scoring for wrong answers. With the new changes, people are daunted by the new format despite it being more 'concept' based and more similar to ACT. 


It is recommended to make the new format more known and funneling resources into education systems more tailored to the new SATs, including funding, subsidies, materials and available SAT resources to improve participation rates.
