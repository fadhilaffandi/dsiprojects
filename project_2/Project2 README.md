## Executive Summary

This report analyses the Ames Housing Data and to provide better predictions of Ames Housing Sale Prices, given descriptive features of the type, condition and information to the respectives houses.

### Problem Statement and Objective:
When houses go on sale, buyers want to get as sense of what kind of houses can fit within their budget. Each buyer has their own preferences and aspects they wish to forgo when considering their budget. 

The aim is to create a model to accurately predict these housing prices, given their information and make better recommendations to these buyers.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:
After creating our model, the house prices generally rely on a specific set of features. The model however is generalised and will not accurately predict exceptions to the norm. Nonetheless, knowing the features will give a better estimate of a housing price and therefore provide better recommendations to those working with a budget.
