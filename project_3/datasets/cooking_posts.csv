INGREDIENTS:

1 scallion

2 cloves of garlic

(optional) 60 grams of any ham product(I used spam)

1 bowl of rice

1 medium egg

Recipe:

First mince the garlic and chop the scallions into small parts, cube the ham too if you have it. Turn the stove on medium, then use any neutral oil to fry the garlic until golden brown when it's done add the scallions. After the oil looks brown enough add the ham once the ham looks cooked add the kimchi and stir fry it until everything looks red reduce the heat to low. Fry the egg(sunny side up) in a different pan and put it onto your cutting board. Now dump the rice into the kimchi mixture and stir it together until the rice is combined with the kimchi.

Want just the picture? [Here.](https://imgur.com/AVOjhIj)

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what you will need:

1. Burger buns, toasted: 4 ea
2. Potatoes, boiled and mashed: 2 medium size\*You can add other veggies like cabbage, French beans, and even broccoli, or a mix of all.
3. Red onion, cut into rings and also finely chopped: 4 rings and 2 Tbsp
4. Tomato, slicer: Cut into slices
5. Thai Chili, minced: 2 \*adjust quantity for desired heat.
6. Ginger, minced: 1 inch pc
7. Garlic, minced: 2 -3cloves
8. Breadcrumbs: 4 tbsp plus extra to coat the patty
9. AP flour: 2 tbsp to make slurry + 2 tbsp to coat the patty.
10. Shredded Cheese, any kind: 4 tbsp
11. Parsley, chopped: 2 tbsp
12. Salt/ pepper: to season
13. Ketchup, mustard, mayo: for the assembly
14. Oil, for frying

Steps:

1. Boil and mash potatoes. Make sure they cool down a bit to avoid getting slimy potatoes.
2. Add all the other finely chopped veg into the mashed potatoes, along with cheese, ginger-garlic-chilies, parsley, breadcrumbs, and salt and pepper to taste. Use AP flour or rice flour in the same quantity as replacement for breadcrumbs.
3. Shape the patties, preferably looking somewhat related to each other – just to ensure even cooking when these are fried.
4. Heat about 1 cup and a half of neutral oil in a heavy bottom pan. When the oil is hot, drop the patties. Cook until golden on all sides.
5. Assemble on toasted buns with condiments of your choice, along with slices of onions and tomatoes.

It would be great if you could include a link to the fundraiser in your posts if you&amp;#39;re also putting up on other social media - &lt;a href=""https://www.ketto.org/fundraiser/ChitrikaforCorona""&gt;https://www.ketto.org/fundraiser/ChitrikaforCorona&lt;/a&gt; 
3) In you&amp;#39;re posting on other social media, consider nominating 2 friends to carry on the challenge. The more this spreads, the more good we can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you guys.&lt;/p&gt;

,Cooking,"Hey everyone. First time posting here from a novice cooking husband, so please forgive me if this is dumb.

Is there a ""trick"" to using stainless steel? We've been using these pots and skillets from a set for a while now. Brand is Cuisinart if that makes a difference. But this one in particular has given us trouble recently. Wife tried heating up some olive oil in it at the start of a recipe as per usual, but it started burning almost instantly and left this nasty residue on it as it baked almost completely in. I tried scrubbing it out and even used a baking soda vinegar 'trick' I found online but it almost didn't affect it at all. I basically gave up and figured it would come off on its own after a while of cooking more things in it (probably noob mistake number 1)

So a week or so later we now we just tried cooking bacon in it. Sure enough it stuck to it (never had aacon stick to a pan before) and started burning almost immediately. We traded to a smaller non-stick pan and it worked as normal.

Now I'm not sure if we ruined the pan or we just have no idea how stainless steel works. I'll include a picture below of the ""aftermath"". So If we've committed a crime against cookware and you don't want to see the result I'd look on with caution.

Thanks in advance.

,Cooking,"I have some ""inherited"" cookware that desperately needs to be upgraded.  Goal is to do the most with the least number of pieces.

I make a lot of curries, pan sauces, stir fries, grains, beans.  I eat a mostly plant-based diet and hardly cook meat at home.  I occasionally make meat/eggs and stuff for my girlfriend.  The cast irons below are great and my main workhorses but when it comes to making pan sauces/curries/tomato sauces etc.. they're not ideal.

My pot/pan list:

* 12"" Cast Iron Skillet, 10"" Cast Iron Skillet
   * Had em for over 10 years.  I will never get rid of them.
* 6qt nonstick stockpot with no lid
   * inherited, it's my only option for mirepoix &amp; the like for curry/sauce/soup bases because of the below stockpot.  I really hate non-stick stuff.
* 8qt stockpot + lid
   * absolute piece of shit, some metal plate base glued onto a paper-thin aluminum pot.  Burns EVERYTHING it touches.  Essentially have it for its size (and making beans+rice requires 2 pots)

(1) I would like one 12"" tri-ply stainless steel saute pan/skillet.  I am troubled deciding which one--I feel the saute pan will be more versatile as it will have a lid (most skillets I see do not) and I can use it with my 12"" steamer basket, make tomato sauce (I like a pan better than a pot so I can finish the pasta in it), curries, stir fry etc... The tall-ish sides are attractive to me.  Skillet is a tad redundant with the cast iron for those applications.

(2) The stockpots need replacing.  I do need two pot-like vessels because I make a lot of rice/bean variants.  I was thinking a saucepan and a stockpot; A 4-5qt saucepan (would cover oatmeal other grains, some sauces/reductions) and a 6-8qt wide (\~10-12"") stockpot (pasta, beans, chilis, stews).  I want tri-ply stainless as well, but am thinking to save some money and just get a tri-ply base.  Are the tri-ply sides really necessary in these applications?

,Cooking,"Picture [here](http://imgur.com/a/TVK5DN4).

I had about 3/4 gallon of whole milk that was about to expire so I decided to try making yogurt in my instant pot.

8 cups milk

1/4 cup plain yogurt with active live cultures

Put milk in instant pot, change setting to yogurt and press until it reads 'boil' (leave the vent open). Let it do it's thing, about 45 minutes? use a thermometer and make sure it's at least 180° but doesn't exceed 200°. Mine stopped at 178° so I put it back on for a few minutes.

Take the lid off, let it cool for about an hour until it reaches 110°. Remove the skin. Ladle a spoonful into a bowl and mix your starter (the plain yogurt) before adding it all back in to the instant pot and giving it a quick stir.

Put the lid on with the vent open, click yogurt again until it reads 8 hours. Walk away and come back in 8 hours.

After the timer goes off, remove the inner pot, cover with plastic wrap or foil, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.

At this point, whisk it up and the yogurt is done. Sweeten it, eat it, cook with it. But if you want Greek yogurt, grab a fine mesh strainer and double line it with cheesecloth and put it over a bowl. Put it in the fridge for a few hours, I think I put mine in for 2 1/2 hours.

&lt;p&gt;I had about 3/4 gallon of whole milk that was about to expire so I decided to try making yogurt in my instant pot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8 cups milk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1/4 cup plain yogurt with active live cultures&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put milk in instant pot, change setting to yogurt and press until it reads &amp;#39;boil&amp;#39; (leave the vent open). Let it do it&amp;#39;s thing, about 45 minutes? use a thermometer and make sure it&amp;#39;s at least 180° but doesn&amp;#39;t exceed 200°. Mine stopped at 178° so I put it back on for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the lid off, let it cool for about an hour until it reaches 110°. Remove the skin. Ladle a spoonful into a bowl and mix your starter (the plain yogurt) before adding it all back in to the instant pot and giving it a quick stir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put the lid on with the vent open, click yogurt again until it reads 8 hours. Walk away and come back in 8 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the timer goes off, remove the inner pot, cover with plastic wrap or foil, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, whisk it up and the yogurt is done. Sweeten it, eat it, cook with it. But if you want Greek yogurt, grab a fine mesh strainer and double line it with cheesecloth and put it over a bowl. Put it in the fridge for a few hours, I think I put mine in for 2 1/2 hours. Transfer the yogurt into a covered container and the whey (what drips off) into a different container. Don&amp;#39;t dump the whey unless you want to, there&amp;#39;s some good stuff you can do with it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out really good, even plain it tastes better compared to the store bought stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

I just moved to Canada two months ago, and I am enjoying it so much specially access to many ingredients!!   
Before moving here, I planned to go around North America to enjoy the culture and specially the food.  Now that I cannot travel, I'm recreating the tastes and smells of the places I would have visited.

I had an amazing experience recreating Lobster rolls original recipe from Connecticut, which consists of lobster, buns and butter! it is served warm contrary to Maine's version which has mayo in it and is served cold (I am also going to cook the cold version to honor Maine very soon!)

I even made New England style hot dog buns, they are the best buns I have ever had, I am used to get them from the store, the ones I made were tender, fresh and had a lot of flavor!

,Cooking,"So a few weeks ago I used my pizza stone. I rinsed it off real quick with water while scrubbing off the residue, left it out to dry for about 24 hours. When I put it away, I put the instructions on top of it and put it back in the box with styrofoam.  


Well I guess the pizza stone wasn't fully dry, as the instructions were now soaked and mold was growing on them (as it had been sitting for weeks). The smell of the mold is now in my pizza stone. I've tried applying a baking soda paste numerous times and have left out in the sun. It's diminished the smell but not taken it away fully.  


Did I just completely ruin my pizza stone?

I'm looking to purchase a broiler-safe lasagna pan.

Things I Want

    Quality metal pan that will not buckle under high heat

    Size should be roughly 9""x13""x3""

    Approximate 15-16 cup capacity

Things I Do Not Want

    Ceramic, porcelain, unglazed cast iron

Preferences

    Stainless steel rather than aluminum

    Straight-sided rather than sloped

    Handles that are flat to the horizontal plane of the pan or no handles at all

    A fitted lid would be nice, but not a deal breaker

Please hit me with your recommendations. My usual Google-Fu has failed me in my quest. Cheers.

ETA: I'm looking for a metal pan because I want to be able to use it under the broiler without risk of cracking due to thermal shock.

,Cooking,"Hi, 

Just making this post so that others can be aware of an absolutely disgusting business practice by America's Test Kitchen. 

I love their site and am signed up for their newsletter. I got an email a few days ago advertising a ""free 3 week trial"" of their site, which I was interested in. To start the trial, I had to sign up and enter my credit card details since they have membership set to auto-renew after the 3-week trial ends, this is pretty standard and what I was expecting, so I entered my details. On that page they had a note saying ""Cancel free anytime"". 

So I get signed up and begin a few cooking school classes. I also just wanted to check how to cancel the auto-renew in case I didnt feel like paying at the end of the trial. And so began my journey into their absolute mind-fuck of a website. They have different pages for accounts etc. and no-where in my ""account"" information do they let you click cancel your account. 

They also don't let you remove your credit card or payment method. 

Only when I go to their help section and find ""how to cancel the subscription"" do they inform you that the only way to cancel is to either email or call them - you can't do it online. 

Not only that, they have 3 different bloody trials for their different sites that will charge you if you sign up for each, and each has to be cancelled separately. 

I emailed them 3 days ago requesting an immediate cancellation of all auto-renew. However, they ignored that mail and since I still haven't heard back from them at all, tonight I had to call at bloody 11.30pm Australia time since their phone service is only for US hours. And it is not easy to call the damn 1800 number internationally, plus I got charged full international rates.

They also have a piss-poor automated voice command phone service that sent me down another damn rabbit hole before I could speak with anyone. The lady I spoke to was robotic and just asked for my details and then finally processed the cancellation, when I started (politely but directly) giving feedback on this poor experience, she hung up on me.

So anyway, I am just writing this post to vent and to make sure others are aware of how difficult and predatory they make it to cancel their trial. I am tech-savvy, but there would be thousands of older people who will have been sucked into paying for the auto-renewal without knowing how to get it cancelled easily. They let international people sign up, but they don't offer an international number to call or international hours of telephone operation. 

I am absolutely disgusted that such a ""reputable"" business would run their site and trial this way. Really surprising because their content is generally pretty great, and with a things like their ""equipment reviews"" on YouTube and stuff they really market themselves as a business to be trusted.

,Cooking,"This is my first time posting in r/Cooking. There's a ""famous"" soup on r/slowcooking that I'm going to make for dinner tomorrow. The link to the recipe is here: [Slow Cooker Creamy Tortellini, Spinach, and Chicken Soup](https://www.365daysofcrockpot.com/slow-cooker-tortellini-spinach-soup/).

My goals are to (a) make it on the stove instead of the slow cooker, and (b) improve the recipe's techniques/ingredients so that the flavor of the final soup is overall better &amp; more robust.

Some of my questions/thoughts:

(1) The recipe calls for microwaving onions, flour, basil, garlic, tomato paste — no way. I figure sauteing would be a major improvement. Should I make a roux? If so, when should I make/add it?

(2) I'm going to use homemade chicken stock instead of canned broth.

**Cooking Process**

· Wash the raw chicken pieces 2-3 times and transfer to a large bowl. Add the lemon juice, turmeric powder, salt, red chili powder, shredded/crushed garlic, and fresh curd. Mix nicely so that all the chicken pieces are coated with the spices and curd. Set aside and let it marinate for 1 hour at room temperature.

· Place a wide wok (Kadhai) on the stove at medium-high heat. Pour the oil (2 Tbsp) into the wok.

· Once the oil is hot, set the heat to low. Now, add the bay leaf, cinnamon stick, hot spice powder (garam masala), and cloves. Cook the spices for a minute by stirring gently.

· Next, add the medium-chopped onions. Fry for 5-6 minutes until the onions are softened. (\*Do not fry the onions too long as we are looking for a pinkish hue instead of a golden brown color)

· Add the chopped tomatoes and fry them (by stirring regularly) for 4-5 minutes.

· Now, add the grated coconut and continue frying for another 4-5 more minutes.

· When you notice that the ingredients have start sticking to the wok slightly, add half a cup of water and continue to stir-cook for 2-3 minutes!

· Now, turn off the stove! Take out the aromatic fried mixture into a dish and let it cool on the kitchen top. Once cooled, transfer to a blender and make a smooth paste.

· Turn on the stove once again and heat the remaining oil (2tbsp) in the same wok (Kadhai).

· Transfer the marinated chicken pieces into the wok. Also, pour 1/3 cup of water. Sauté the chicken in the wok for 1-2 minutes, then cover with a lid, and let it cook for 20 minutes over low heat.

· After 20 minutes, uncover the lid and turn the heat to high. Add the earlier prepared aromatic paste into the chicken and mix well for a couple of minutes. 

· Finally, adjust the heat to low, cover once again with a lid, and cook for 10 minutes until the meat becomes tender.

· As soon as you uncover the lid, you will notice the meat has released the oil. It is a sign of doneness, therefore turn off the stove!

Also, do you think I could use &amp;quot;used up&amp;quot; elderflower for the fritters, that is to say after the soaking for the juice? I assume they would be much less aromatic, but am unsure whether it would work at all..&lt;/p&gt;

I realize there is a more expensive and less expensive version of virtually every single product you can buy, but below are the ones I think are worth the splurge.  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Jarred marinara sauce - Rao's brand will change the way you think of marinara  
2. Olive oil - extra virgin, a plus if you can get single origin (favorites include Trader Joe's 100% Greek and Cobram Estate)  
3. Feta cheese - specifically the sheep's milk variety  
4. Salsa - Green Mountain Gringo is amazing, but so pricey...  
5. Eggs - Pasture raised for flavor (brighter yellow yolks) and for ethical reasons  

&amp;#x200B;

Alternatively, below are the items that I have noticed no difference in quality when buying the lower priced option.  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Dried beans - much cheaper than canned and the flavor and texture is better when cooked yourself, plus you can control the spice/salt content  
2. Whole spices - cheaper than their ground counterparts and they retain their flavor much longer. Simply toast/fry/ground when the recipe calls it  
3. Grains and rice - the bulk bins are cheaper than the name brand options, and again the flavors seem exactly the same  
4. Nut butters - Trader Joe's nut butters taste equal to the artisanal brands out there, from what I have seen

I've recently become obsessed with the idea of perfecting the classic French omelette, but I don't have a nonstick pan. I have a carbon steel pan on the way, but I've been using a nice stainless pan in the meantime.

I end up sacrificing that smooth, glossy surface that you get with nonstick but the texture and flavor are great otherwise. My folks don't want to buy nonstick for reasons I don't really understand, but I'm happy to commit to learning how to use carbon steel as I know that's been the way classic omelettes have been made for ages.

,Cooking,"This will sound ridiculous and I don’t have a strong argument against it, but I’ve only cooked once in my life and I’m 30 years old.  I attempted a few years back to make a grilled cheese and had no idea how the cheese would melt and put the cheese side down.  Yes I know, it’s beyond pathetic, especially coming from an Italian descent.   But growing up Italian, the women took care of that, which was not my rule or mindset but my mother and grandmother just never really let me in the kitchen and if I was hungry they made something.   So after my grilled cheese incident I “retired” if you will.   

However, my fiancée works extremely hard and has a tough job.  I work a shit ton of hours, 6 days a week, and for all intents and purposes, am the “bread winner” albeit I hate that term.  She typically comes home every day from her job which is mentally and physically tough, and cooks and cleans and does laundry and is a saint.   She jokingly from time to time makes jokes about what IM making for dinner, and we laugh it off but I hate it.  Now granted with my schedule I wouldn’t have dinner ready every night until 9-10 anyway, but I digress.   I’m off every Sunday as we’re closed, and I’ve thought about cooking but I know while she’s home she would take over.    So I finally have a day off, while she’s at work and would really like to make dinner and show my appreciation for everything she does.  With that being said and in mind, it’s roughly 12:00 noon right now my time, and my fiancée will be home by 4:10. 

With a potential trip the market possibly in play, does anyone have a recommendation for a dinner I can make that’s extremely entry level for someone like myself that’s not extremely time consuming? While browsing the internet I saw many recommendations for crock pot type style meals that you virtually cannot mess up, I believe my procrastination has eliminated that idea.

Yes I know, it’s beyond pathetic, especially coming from an Italian descent.   But growing up Italian, the women took care of that, which was not my rule or mindset but my mother and grandmother just never really let me in the kitchen and if I was hungry they made something.   So after my grilled cheese incident I “retired” if you will.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my fiancée works extremely hard and has a tough job.  I work a shit ton of hours, 6 days a week, and for all intents and purposes, am the “bread winner” albeit I hate that term.  She typically comes home every day from her job which is mentally and physically tough, and cooks and cleans and does laundry and is a saint.   She jokingly from time to time makes jokes about what IM making for dinner, and we laugh it off but I hate it.  Now granted with my schedule I wouldn’t have dinner ready every night until 9-10 anyway, but I digress.   I’m off every Sunday as we’re closed, and I’ve thought about cooking but I know while she’s home she would take over.    So I finally have a day off, while she’s at work and would really like to make dinner and show my appreciation for everything she does.  With that being said and in mind, it’s roughly 12:00 noon right now my time, and my fiancée will be home by 4:10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a potential trip the market possibly in play, does anyone have a recommendation for a dinner I can make that’s extremely entry level for someone like myself that’s not extremely time consuming? While browsing the internet I saw many recommendations for crock pot type style meals that you virtually cannot mess up, I believe my procrastination has eliminated that idea.    Please help me help my fiancée to show her a big thank you!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, thank you in advance for the replies and ideas!!&lt;/p&gt;

* The USDA **errs on the side of safety. Hence, they encourage meats to be cooked almost well done. Rare beef is discouraged. The eating of sashimi and raw fish is discouraged. Rinsing chicken is discouraged. Now how many of us really cook beef to the recommended USDA guidelines every time(medium well)?**
* Life is a risk.
* I scrub my workspace with soap and water after breaking down chicken anyways, so everything gets cleaned up.
* No matter if I rinse the chicken or not, I'm getting chicken guts and goo all over my butcher block and hands because I'm handling this chicken as I break it down, so either way, I'm exposed to potential bacteria contamination.
* My reason for breaking down the chicken isn't to rinse off germs. That's a strawman red herring argument. It's to get rid of dirt, blood, plasma, saliva, feces, hair, feather fragments, coagulated juices and anything else that could have been accumulating on the bird as it travels through a not-so-clean industrial processing plant.
* I don't trust industrial meat processing plants. Maybe I should trust them more? Nah.....
* If you would definitely rinse off a chicken that comes from a wet market, what makes you think a Tyson or Pilgrim industrial plant or industrial chicken coop is any better? How far do you think we have come since Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle?""
* [This guy from EllenTube describes my position best.](https://youtu.be/l0vJmd3W58U) Maybe it's a cultural divide?
* The Japanese rinse off all fish and chicken generously. I've seen videos of the best ramen makers in Japan, and they definitely rinse off their chicken with a nozzle at a rinsing station and pat it dry before making stock with their chicken. I trust their protocols.
* Even the Chinese use a blanche (basically just a boiling rinse) when making any sort of chicken. Their rationale? ""To get rid of the nastys""
* I'm not going to take a whole chicken straight out of the bag, dripping with goo and what not, and put it straight into boiling water to make stock. I just am **just not doing that.** Even if the USDA tells us that's what we should do.

I'm also aware I need to be conscious that I'll have to stew the neck bones longer. John's recipe calls for a simmer of 3 hours, but the neck bone recipes I've looked recommend 6 hours.

,Cooking,"Hey all,

I recently graduated from college and was gifted a Lodge Skillet. I have been cooking for myself for a few years, and was amped when I received this as I've wanted one for a long time.

The thing I'm running into issues with is learning how to maintain a proper temperature when cooking some thicker cuts of meat like steak. I unfortunately am cooking on an electric glass stove top, which I know isn't necessarily the best for this type of cookware.

Previously when using regular steel pans, I would blast the heat on the burner to 9.5 (highest step below HI) and would throw the steaks in once the pan warmed, leave on each side for about 2:30/3 mins, flip do the same, then lower the heat to around 4.5/5.5 and baste with butter garlic cloves and thyme for about 1/2 mins on each side. Typically cook NY Strips, usually a little thicker than 1in. The result would be a somewhat charred outside with a perfectly medium rare center.

When using the cast iron, I'm having a tough time knowing what temperatures to use. I've been playing with heat settings and different ways of getting the cast iron up to (what I think is) optimal temps. However, I always either end up with a completely burnt outside and inside, or a undercooked inside that is tough and hard to chew with a decent crust outside. I have read you should use somewhat similar methods to a regular pan, where you can regulate temps after getting it piping hot. Just haven't been able to do it thus far (been about a month worth of 10+ attempts).

Full disclosure, I am doing the correct measures of letting the steak cool to room temp, patting completely dry, and I am always letting the pan get up to the what I think is the correct temperature. I know you have to be patient when using cast iron. I've made some amazing steaks before I started using the Lodge.

What I'm looking for is any tips or experience anyone may have in terms of what heat settings to use with an electric stovetop, and ways to work around the issues I've been having. I'd hope some people have had the same issues I'm having.. I searched around reddit and the internet and couldn't find any answers. Just tired of butchering good cuts of meat, and don't want to resort back to regular pans as I know once you get the hang of cooking with these pieces it makes a big difference.

Hi all,

I had a tenant destroy my cooktop and besides some scratches, most the marks feels like an outside layer/crust which is baked on to the glass cooktop, which I can't seem to get off with usual methods.

Does anyone have any strategies to remove this, if it's even possible to begin with? I heard about weiman glass cook top and a glass ceramic scrunge. Would this do the trick? My last resort is replacing the entire thing, but would like to try and save it..

Questions, methods, and topics I have in mind:

* Does the type of flour, grain, etc. affect the rate of cooking?
* Is frying from cold to hot oil, applicable? Or is it more of a situational method?
* Differences between using baking soda, baking powder, alcohol, carbonated water (club soda), eggs, etc. in batter for frying. 
* Battering: no batter, single batter, double batter+, dry batter, wet batter, wet + dry batter, wet batter with oil, ice cold batter (for tempura) etc. 
* Texture differences from: rice flour, corn starch, potato starch, tapioca starch, cassava starch, almond flour (or meal), all-purpose flour (APF), bread (strong) flour, whole wheat flour, etc. 
* Single fry, double fry, maybe triple or more frying? 
* Using flour or starch on an ingredient to stir fry or satue; will it give it a crispy or crunchy texture? 
* Is it possible to over whip a batter? Should you over whip a batter?

* Should you cook a protein, veggie, etc. before frying?

,Cooking,"So a while back I got a Sirloin butt.  It is somewhere around 12lb.  Sadly when I got it someone threw it into the deep freezer so I couldn't portion it out and I have a thing about re-feezing stuff.  So tomorrow I am cooking up 12lb of sirloin butt.

My first thought is to put the oven to as low as it goes, insert a meat thermometer, and wait till it is nice and medium-rare in the middle.  Possibly after that do a sear of it so it looks nice.

,Cooking,"Hi everyone, I started getting into some serious cooking about 3-4 months ago and with all this free time I've started to look into baking and have recently been able to cook a couple of recipes that include yeast and dough rising which has led me to a couple of questions.

When a recipe calls for letting the dough rest ""until double the size"", they usually cover the container with either a damp cloth or plastic wrap. Is there any difference in doing any of the 2?

When the dough has rested, I've noticed that most of the gained volume is simply air trapped inside the dough. Even if treated extremely carefully, I've never been able to keep the volume while handling the dough. Is it okay to just punch the air out of the dough from the beginning as it will go away anyways?

And lastly, during the rest period I've used plastic wrap to cover the dough. Every time I've done this the plastic wrap inflates like a balloon. I've never seen this in any baking tutorial, it's always the dough pushing against the plastic wrap but never the plastic itself getting all airy. Is this normal? Should I wrap it less tight so that some air can escape?

,Cooking,"Hi everyone, 

   So I live in Mississauga, Ontario, a huge city immediately beside Toronto. Toronto and especially Mississauga have huge Asian populations and as a result there are many Asian grocery stores in my area. 

   Recently I’ve been attempting to get into cooking Japanese cuisine, but I’ve been tearing my hair out trying to find what one would think are some very very basic ingredients. For example, it’s been an uphill battle trying to find bonito flakes and kombu seaweed; the only two ingredients traditionally in  DASHI- ONE OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL BROTHS IN JAPANESE COOKING! So naturally I’m super confused as to why it has been so difficult. I can only find overpriced small boxes of “dashi soup mix” that has bonito but no kombu. I’d really like to try making authentic miso, so I just want the base ingredients. 

   The workers at the grocery stores are mostly non-Japanese I suspect, because none of them ever have any idea what I’m talking about when I inquire about Japanese ingredients. I don’t speak Japanese either, so one of the 20 bottles simply labelled “rice wine” in english could in fact be cooking sake, but I can’t tell. And there are so many different ingredients made from rice that I feel like it would be naïve of me to grab any old vaguely labelled product and assume it’s the right thing. Hell, mirin is also “rice wine” even though it’s a completely different thing from sake. 

When I go on Amazon there is either no seller of the ingredient I need, it’s “currently unavailable” or there’s like two vendors selling one package at a crazy markup for some reason. 

 So, tl;dr: this was mostly a rant but, does anyone have any tips of suggestions as to where/how I can find:

- kombu seaweed
- bonito flakes
- cooking sake
- Tonkatsu sauce
- Thinly sliced rib eye or tenderloin (for gyudon)

,Cooking,"Hi everyone! I’m new here, and I actually searched up this sub just to ask this question. 

What is the absolute best way to make a steak? What are some tips for beginners who have never done it before? What cut of meat do you recommend?

I have been a vegetarian for my whole life, minus tasting a few meat dishes here and there out of curiosity. I’ve only recently begun learning to cook meat as I’ve become very close with my non-vegetarian partner. Cooking for him is a huge joy for me, and one of my favorite things to do that I’m extremely passionate about.

That being said, I have a really nice date planned for us this Friday as a celebration of me graduating undergrad and us being able to move back in together after being separated for quarantine. I would love to make him a really amazing steak, as it’s his favorite food. His personal taste seems pretty “normal” to me, he likes them cooked medium rare and enjoys ordering nicely prepared steaks from restaurants.

For a little more information, I’ll also be making a roasted garlic and parmesan risotto (prepared with Pinot Grigio) and some kind of vegetable I haven’t yet decided on, with tiramisu for dessert.

Edit: I also have fully stocked kitchen supplies such as a thermometer and many different types of pans/cooking methods. So any items that aren’t too obscure I should already have.

,Cooking,"Hello!

So, last week I decided to make a small batch of chicken stock, using the leftover bones from some chicken thighs I'd filleted (with carrots, onions, garlic, celery, thyme and parsley simmered in water for 4 hours). I'm pretty new to stock (and cooking like a grown-up in general), but I think it went pretty well; and we ended up using all of it yesterday to make gravy for a roast chicken. Nothing too fancy just stock, flour, juices from the roast chicken, a few teaspoons of beef gravy granules (which were added without my knowledge in an attempt to 'thicken it up') and salt and pepper.

As nice as it was, there was far too much gravy for the 3 people eating it, so now I have an excess of gravy I don't see being used anytime soon. I was planning on using the entire leftover chicken carcass to make an even bigger batch of stock, and saw an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone (disclaimer: all fowl involved in this story are already deceased at the time of writing). I'm wondering if chucking the leftover chicken gravy to the stock pot is a good idea to reduce waste and enhance tastiness, or if it will mess with the flavour of the new stock and effectively waste a whole batch of perfectly good chicken water?

Hey r/Cooking. Hoping you guys can help me with this one. During quarantine, I have been challenging myself to use up things left in my fridge by my family and cooking more food for myself. However, as an Amateur cook, I'm having trouble finding any literature on the subject on the web. 

I have a quarter bottle of this Asian Zing sauce left, and I have no idea how to finish it off. I try using it as a dip, but its too spicy to actually enjoy. I tried spreading it on some breaded chicken in a sandwich too, and that numbs the heat a bit, but I just get spiced out. 

I'm trying to find a way to use it for all its amazing flavor, but not let my tongue go numb from its heat. I heard maybe marinade works? But I don't know the basics for a marinade and think it might get wasted. I really think it would go great in spicing up a breading like a coating or in some how modifying the sauce to make it more appetizing/Less numbing.

&lt;p&gt;Hey &lt;a href=""/r/Cooking""&gt;r/Cooking&lt;/a&gt;. Hoping you guys can help me with this one. During quarantine, I have been challenging myself to use up things left in my fridge by my family and cooking more food for myself. However, as an Amateur cook, I&amp;#39;m having trouble finding any literature on the subject on the web. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a quarter bottle of this Asian Zing sauce left, and I have no idea how to finish it off. I try using it as a dip, but its too spicy to actually enjoy. I tried spreading it on some breaded chicken in a sandwich too, and that numbs the heat a bit, but I just get spiced out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to find a way to use it for all its amazing flavor, but not let my tongue go numb from its heat. I heard maybe marinade works? But I don&amp;#39;t know the basics for a marinade and think it might get wasted. I really think it would go great in spicing up a breading like a coating or in some how modifying the sauce to make it more appetizing/Less numbing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway you guys could help me out with Ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

- cook sausage of choice
- Scrambled 2 small eggs &amp; 1tsp Water in the stirred French Omelet method.
- when 80% done, scoot eggs to one side and get buttered egg ring into your pan.
- turn heat to LOW and start stacking egg / sausage mix &amp; layers of cheddar cheese into your metal ring.
- do NOT press down (you will force eggs out of the bottom)
- cook for 2mins (including layering time) and then flip! 
- cook for 1 1/2mins and then gently press on top to force out any excess moisture.

- serve inside a biscuit! [ Mr. Alton Brown’s Biscuits ](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/southern-biscuits-recipe-2041990) are the best!

,Cooking,"Hi all,

Hope everyone is doing well and staying safe. I had a question in regards to heating up my meal prep. I'm trying to make the most out of my time and wanting to reduce the amount of back and forth I need to do with my oven when I'm baking/cooking/heating up my meal prep. 

Currently I have my oven timer to automatically start at 10:15AM EST to begin heating up to 350 degrees. At the same time, I take my meal prep out the fridge, put it in a oven pan with foil and have it sit and ready to put in when the oven is ready. The oven will then notify me when it's reached 350 (usually around 10:30AM EST) and I slide the meal prep in and then in approx 30 mins (11:00AM EST) my food is ready. However, I want to be even ***effective*** with time. 

What I want to know is, when the oven timer begins automatically at 10:15AM EST to begin heating up to 350 -- ***at the same time***, can I put my meal prep in? And how much time would that reduce reduce? The food would slowly begin heating up and then I'm thinking it would only need to stay at 350 for maybe 10 or so mins instead of the entire 30 mins?

,Cooking,"One dish I've made a lot for my wife and myself since moving to a place where our local Chipotle is... not good... is ""Chipotle-style"" chicken burrito bowls.  Cilanto-lime rice, black beans, the whole deal.  

One thing I've been trying to figure out is the best way to make the chicken REALLY SPICY without also gassing the kitchen when cooking.  I generally marinade boneless/skinless chicken thighs in the fridge for 4-6 hours in a fairly simple marinade of olive oil, lime juice, minced garlic, onion powder, chili powder, cumin, and various chopped/powdered peppers, seeking the thrill of the heat.  Cook on a medium-high cast iron skillet for maybe 6 minutes per side, or until done.

We're both from Arizona originally and LOVE really spicy food.  We're the type of people who convince our local Indian food restaurant to serve us ""7"" spicy dishes when the scale only goes to 5.

Last night I tried to add some ghost pepper powder to the marinade.  I added about 1/2 teaspoon of the powder to the marinade for 2.5 pounds of chicken.  When I cooked them in my cast iron skilled later, I could REALLY FEEL the spiciness cooking off the skillet/chicken, but honestly the actual chicken itself was underwhelming.  Did the powder just cook off?  Did I need to use more of it?

Cilanto-lime rice, black beans, the whole deal.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I&amp;#39;ve been trying to figure out is the best way to make the chicken REALLY SPICY without also gassing the kitchen when cooking.  I generally marinade boneless/skinless chicken thighs in the fridge for 4-6 hours in a fairly simple marinade of olive oil, lime juice, minced garlic, onion powder, chili powder, cumin, and various chopped/powdered peppers, seeking the thrill of the heat.  Cook on a medium-high cast iron skillet for maybe 6 minutes per side, or until done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re both from Arizona originally and LOVE really spicy food.  We&amp;#39;re the type of people who convince our local Indian food restaurant to serve us &amp;quot;7&amp;quot; spicy dishes when the scale only goes to 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I tried to add some ghost pepper powder to the marinade.  I added about 1/2 teaspoon of the powder to the marinade for 2.5 pounds of chicken.  When I cooked them in my cast iron skilled later, I could REALLY FEEL the spiciness cooking off the skillet/chicken, but honestly the actual chicken itself was underwhelming.  Did the powder just cook off?  Did I need to use more of it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To &amp;quot;test&amp;quot; it I dipped a single tine of a fork into the powder, pulled it out, saw only a few flakes on it, and then tasted it, and holy hell this is actually ghost chili powder.  So I think the issue is in my technique more than the ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Question in OP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say you just wanted to learn to make a meat dish involving a chicken thigh and some sides.  What would you choose for your sides to have broad appeal? Maybe some mashed potatoes or something? But that seems like it would take a while to make.&lt;/li&gt;

Whenever I used to make rice by the classic conventional wisdom I would have two big issues. The rice would over boil (yes even on the absolute lowest my stove(s) go (I've moved so I have been able to test this on two different cook-tops). Overboiling rice is a fucking mess and means you have to sit there and babysit the rice whenever you make it. Not fun.

The second, larger problem is that I would get very sticky mushy rice. They would all breakdown into more of a thick porridge rather than nice individually defined grains. Gross, and a waste of good rice.

I just tried mixing the two methods, washing the rice, then toasting and adding boiling water, came out mushy and gross again. The issue is the washing, something about it ruins rice.

I've been made to quarantine with my parents and my mother is really making things difficult.  

Now, I'm not a chef but I can make everything from pie to steak without a recipe card.  I love to cook and I love trying new foods.  

Before,  when I came for visits,  my mother was always excited to see what new foods I might introduce.  That is no longer the case. 

She's begun to complain about every single meal.  Too spicy,  too salty, too fattening, she doesn't like the herbs, etc. Sometimes it's that it includes cruciferous vegetables or beans. 

I've been 'banned' from baking entirely and accused of making her fat. 

It's gotten to the point that I dread my turn to make dinner because it means another round of insults and accusations. 

I don't want to lose my joy for cooking but how do I keep it when it results in such negativity?  

Help?

,Cooking,"I've never been a rice cooker type of person.

First, I felt like an appliance for one thing was overkill and second I didn't each rice all that much.

A few months ago, I found myself reading the article named in the title and it got me super excited. So I put the Zoji that Ebert recommends in an Amazon cart and right before I ordered, I thought I'd just check what the internet says.

Goddam did this not get complicated. Ebert seems to say that the rice cooker can do pretty much everything while the internet insists that it's mostly just good for rice and some other things and I can't tell who's right and who's wrong (but I've very tempted to side with Roger and get his book and just do what he says).

So I would really really love if knowledgeable people could clear it for me.

If it helps, what sold me in the article is the brainless aspect. I've been known to skip meal after meal because coming up with a recipe and the motivation to execute it is enough to lose my attention about six times. I'm still baffled that most humans wake up everyday and don't spend hours agonizing on what to eat. There are even myths of people who do that many times per day, not just once, which is already a herculean task for me.

,Cooking,"I absolutely love ""Cajun"" foods. I put that in quotes because I can't say that I've necessarily had truly authentic Cajun food, what I'm referring to is what restaurants will label as Cajun: Cajun chicken sandwich, Cajun chicken pasta, Cajun fries, etc.

Recently I've wanted to make some Cajun food at home, but at first I wasn't able to find any Cajun seasoning at the store, but eventually I found two different brands. Trying them both out, they're not the same. They have a similar taste but one is definitely better than the other.

I decided I would try to make my own, but it's amazing to me the difference among recipes.

There seems to be some constants in every recipe:
- Onion Powder
- Garlic Powder
- Black Pepper
- Cayenne Pepper
- Paprika
- Salt
- Oregano

But then some recipes call for:
- White Pepper
- Smoked Paprika instead of Paprika
- Thyme
- Instead of oregano and/or thyme, Italian seasoning
- Red chili flakes
- Seasoning salt

And it's really hard for me to decide which recipe to try. I'm really looking to mimic what I would taste if I went to a restaurant and ordered a Cajun chicken biscuit with Cajun fries. There's like a subtle sweetness and smoothness to what you get at a restaurant that I personally am not imagining coming from any of the ingredients I've seen so far, but maybe I'm wrong.

Add crushed garlic cloves, let sweat for a minute
Add diced onions, let sweat
Add San Maranzano tomatoes, bring to a boil
Let boil for a minute, simmer for 2 hours
Season to taste
When it’s done I use an immersion blender to get a think consistency

&lt;p&gt;I need help adding simple yet nutritious recipes to my collection. Or even just the knowledge of what I should be eating each meal to have a balanced, whole meal to get all my nutrients, especially protein. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a love for burritos/wraps. If you have any simple recipes for those, that’d be awesome too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice or guidance is appreciated, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

its been nearly three months since I've had any meat and I don't think I go on much longer and because of the ongoing pandemic, I've been very reluctant to buy food or meat outside but I plan on getting meat delivered.

I've read articles about how cooking in 165 °f can instantly kill or 140-150 °f for a while can kill any germs/virus for chicken but I am an amateur cook, I don't own a meat thermometer and can't buy one on the account of the lock down banning sale of non-essential goods in my country, is there a way I can approximate the cooking temperature based on the amount of time I cook it?

I cook chicken breasts on a stove-top, on a skillet. is there a way to know the approximate time required to reach those temperatures in medium and/or medium-high flame? i usually cook breasts for about 6-8 mins a side on medium flame, will that reach an internal temperature of those above temperatures? do I need to cook longer or maybe less?",t2_1fx5kypk,False,,0,False,Need help with chicken breast cooking temperature,[],r/Cooking,False,6,,0,False,t3_gdeog6,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1588638259.0,text,6,,,text,self.Cooking,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hello,&lt;/p&gt;

I wasn’t planning on going to the grocery store for another week so I needed to make my own enchilada sauce when I’ve only ever bought the canned stuff. I mishmashed a bunch of recipes to work with what I had and it came out surprisingly good! I hope you guys like!


(Red) Enchilada Sauce Recipe 

2 whole dried ancho chili 
— OR 4 dried Chipotle peppers 
1 Tablespoon red pepper flakes 
2-3 cups water 

2 Poblano peppers
2 red bell peppers
4 whole cloves garlic
Salt (big punches depending on pepper size)

2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 a medium white onion 
1 can whole tomatoes 
1 tablespoon chili powder
1/2 tablespoon cumin 
1/2 tablespoon oregano
1 teaspoon cocoa powder
1 bay leaf
1 cup water 

—————————————————-

Heat oven to 200*. Cut the stems off and halve the fresh peppers. You want the seeds so don’t cut out the gils. Toss in olive oil and a generous amount of salt until coated. Place cut side down with whole garlic cloves on a sheet pan and put in oven for 45 minutes, or until the pepper skins blister. 

Toast the dried peppers and red pepper flakes in a hot, dry pan for about 90 seconds (open the windows, turn on the hood fan, and cover your mouth and nose with a kitchen towel!) After toasting, put in a bowl and cover peppers with boiling water (I heat mine up in an electric kettle; 2-3 cups should do it). Seal the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and set aside. As the peppers rehydrate (about half an hour), the water will turn a  reddish color that can be light or very dark, depending on the peppers you use. You’ll use this water with the rest of the recipe. 

Rough chop the onion into large pieces. Heat olive oil on medium-high heat in a Dutch oven or heavy bottomed pot that has a lid. Once the oil is sizzling, add the onion and stir until par cooked, about 3 minutes. Add canned tomatoes, spices and 1 cup water. Cover and let it come to a boil. Once it’s bubbling, add the blistered peppers and garlic, and the whole bowl of dried peppers and water. 

Lower the heat to a lite simmer and cover. Stir occasionally for the next two hours, or until everything is breaking down together (the dried peppers will still have some firmness but that’s okay), and you’ll see it reduce about an inch in the pot. 

Pull off the heat and let cool completely (covered) on the counter. Once cooled, ladle into a blender and purée until smooth. 

This should make about 2 1/2 quarts and can be frozen. Also, I threw in some fresh tomatoes and carrots last minute that weren’t going to make it much longer, so it can be a good “clean out the fridge” recipe.",t2_12q1jk,False,,0,False,Homemade red enchilada sauce (not really traditional but it came out great),[],r/Cooking,False,6,,0,False,t3_gd9cd5,False,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,True,,False,,[],{},,True,,1588617919.0,text,6,,,text,self.Cooking,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My sisters and I have been having cooking zoom nights and last night we all made enchiladas together.

,Cooking,"So, this year for my wonderful boyfriend's 2nd birthday together, he suggested I make him a three-course dinner as a fun birthday gift since we can't really go out anywhere to celebrate it. Since we've been stuck inside all of the time lately we've been watching a lot of shows online, and we've recently become obsessed with Masterchef which I think kind of sparked this idea. 

I really love this idea but I should mention that I'm a little bit newer to cooking, and while I think I'm pretty ok with it, I want to figure out what I want to make ahead of time so I have time to practice and perfect a dish. I would really love some easy but sophisticated yummy ideas to blow his socks of with and make his birthday super special :P

For the appetizer I was thinking of doing some broccoli soup and goat cheese because it's super easy AND really yummy (I pretty much have this down already thanks to youtube and Gordon Ramsey), however I'd be open to any other ideas too.

For the main course I was thinking of perhaps doing a steak or a homemade pizza, both of which I know I could nail, or maybe something different we've never tried like duck. I'm definitely open to ideas here too :P

And for desert I really have no clue...I'm ordering him a custom cake, but I'd also like to make him something homemade to go with the theme of the night. Perhaps a chocolate mouse, some chocolate truffles, doughnuts, brownies, lemon bars...or even a lava cake if it's not too difficult to make. I don't know though, I really need help here!

Also for just a teeny little more context we both love mexican food, he has a huge sweet tooth and his favorite candy is snickers lol. We both love tuna (though I've never cooked it) and I LOVE potatoes lol.

I'm just so excited to get to do this for him since he's normally the one who cooks in our relationship, and I really want to make sure it ALL works together and turns out super special.

Try making it yourself. You'll quickly realise that mustard isn't mustard.  Fiery British mustard, American yellow condiment, Chinese, Dijon, German, all the same, all different.

,Cooking,"I have worked professionally for over 10 years in my past, and have cut a shit ton of everything under the sun, but tonight while making dinner I noticed how much easier it was for me to perfectly, and efficiently mince garlic compared to an onion. I don't much care for perfect cuts at home, and never spend that much time on the prep unless I'm making Bolognese. 

It just felt a lot simpler to use the knife to cut the garlic, albeit a lot more dangerous considering how close my fingers got to the blade. At any rate that made me think about whether it would easier to teach knife skills to a beginner by learning on garlic as opposed to an onion.

Lettuce for salad works well, too, but not often do I have to chop a few cases at a time when cooking with someone. More thinking of things you chop here than slice like a squash. 

Carrots are the worst thing in the world to dice. Good experience, but they are wicked vegetables which cause blisters. Anything better than garlic? I suppose ginger works as well. 

Maybe potatoes would be best? I grew up cooking and holding a knife so I don't really remember where or how I learned. I mean I learned a lot of advanced techniques working with chefs but most of the time that doesn't have a huge place in home cooking for your average person that is interested in learning and has no idea how to handle a knife efficiently.

&lt;p&gt;Carrots are the worst thing in the world to dice. Good experience, but they are wicked vegetables which cause blisters. Anything better than garlic? I suppose ginger works as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe potatoes would be best? I grew up cooking and holding a knife so I don&amp;#39;t really remember where or how I learned. I mean I learned a lot of advanced techniques working with chefs but most of the time that doesn&amp;#39;t have a huge place in home cooking for your average person that is interested in learning and has no idea how to handle a knife efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, I have a stroganoff in the oven now (covered) that is essentially finished, but I&amp;#39;m hoping to tenderize the cheap stewing beef for about 4 hrs. I currently have the oven at 225, and for the life of me I can&amp;#39;t decide if that is too hot, or too cold. I did a few Google searches but didn&amp;#39;t really see anything related to what I was doing, and I&amp;#39;m not jacking the oven up to 350. 250 feels more correct to me.&lt;/p&gt;

The meat has this weird, but mild,  tangy taste to it. If I had to describe it, I'd almost say it tastes a bit fermented. which makes me think it's spoiled.

The company sends the meals in cold boxes by fedex, so it's plausible that they didn't stay cold enough (edit: they seemed 'borderline' cold enough when they arrived, meaning I had doubts if it was not quite cold enough at the time I opened the box)

The reason I'm asking is that I stopped using my first meal delivery service for this reason, and when I started using my new meal service, the meat tasted noticeably fresher/fine.

But the 2nd and 3rd week of my deliveries, I'm tasting that weird tangy taste again and I had to throw out my meal.  I don't know if it could be due to poor meat supply from COVID or poor temperature control in transport.

But I know I am just paranoid because most food reaches safe internal temperature well before it is well done. I have been working with my obsession with mixed success. When I went from well done to medium rare, I started turning out juicier, more succulent meat.  And though I like it, my daughter doesn’t. She wrinkles her nose when she sees pink in the meat.

,Cooking,"I've started cooking Sunday dinners for my family, for the first time, last week. The first attempt was a first attempt. I kept it simple, or tried too, I seasoned the roast with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and some mustard powder, and throw some thyme onto the roast before, searing it on the grill. Then I threw it into the slow cooker, and filled it w/ a whole container of beef broth, a diced onion, and at most a table spoon of worchestire sauce, and threw in some carrots and potatoes for the sake of having some vegetables. Left it cooking for about 7 hours and the roast turned out pretty well, as I think my family seemed to enjoy it. 

Beacuse, truth be told. I don't really cook for others too often, if at all and as a result I, often find myself cooking for myself. Today my brother said, I guess your taking over Sunday dinners from now on. An, Oh boy! I feel like I had to step up my game. 

So now I currently have the roast marinating in a mixture of olive oil, worchestire sauce, lemon juice, and a bottle of Pepsi w/ a table spoon of garlic, and a whole onion. - Ideally though, I would've used beer but, I know my mom doesn't drink and I can respect that. The second option would've been Dr. Pepper but, I didn't have any on hand. The marinade smells good though. 

After the marinade, I plan on patting it dry with some paper towels, and seasoning it with some mustard powder, sea salt, pepper, w/ a sprinkling of  cayenne pepper, and then follow it up with a nice sear in some olive oil. Then finishing it in the slow cooker filled with some beef broth, and let it cook for about 8 hours. 

I'm really hoping that it'll turn out as well. Mind you, I am cooking off the top of my head, as I'm not following any sort of recipe. I'm not sure how it'll turn out but, I'm dying of excited because, I can't wait see how it turns out but, I am also dying to know what they'll think of it.

I'm in the process of embarking on a cooking journey or at least trying to cook more. One of the foods I'm looking to improve in the morning is my scrambled eggs.

I've got my eggs down pat, so no need for advice there, however I'm looking to improve my mix ins.

Presently, I'm adding fresh chilli, mushrooms, tomato, capsaicin and a savory sauce. It's amazing. What's less amazing is the effort I have to go through to batch prepare my mix ins. That's where hopefully you come in!

I'm seeking advice on how to best preserve and store my mix ins. Hopefully so I can just chuck it in the pan, stir it around, add my eggs and be good to go.

I've tried a few exotic options like herbs in an ice cube tray with oil, water, sauce, etc. But none seem to really work. They either melt and burn, melt too slow, get super fucked up by heat or simply dont freeze well.

Here are some of those.

1. ""Scalding tightens the skin and thus improves crispiness."" Why would that be?

2. ""Scalding gives a head start to the skin, and thus one can get crispy skin while avoiding to overcook the bird."" The skin is warm after scalding, not hot. Any headstart is very limited. Also, wouldn't the result be similar to starting roasting at very high temp and finish at a lower temp?

3. ""The Scald and Dry (in a fridge) method, scalding gives a head start to the drying part, it dries better, and drier skin means crisper bird."" Why not hang the bird for one more day uncovered in the fridge?

None of the explanations seem to be entirely satisfactory. I'll add my own speculation to the list. Water is an extremely good heat conductor, much more so than even much hotter air, therefore the very rapid temperature increase from that scalding stage damages skin cells in a way that a more gradual temperature increase in a hot oven wouldn't do.

General base is below, though I change it from time to time. Emphasis on ""spice"" variations/additions. Anybody have any suggestions for changing it up a bit? Not necessarily willing to give entirely on my base, but any additions or variations that any cooks out there think might provide an added touch would be fantastic.

General consistency is:
Onion, or shallot if you so choose
Garlic
Celery
Beef/Turkey
Tomato sauce
Ortega salsa (can't tell you why, it just works)
Brooks hot chili beans (same as above - just works)
Beer (preferably lager style... Labatt Blue. Canadian water makes all the difference - Niagara Falls I, guess.)

Thai sriracha powder
Chili powder
Cumin
Touch of Garam Marsala

Garlic powder
Onion powder
Salt to taste
Pepper pepper to taste
Sriracha if you need, but the thai sriracha powder works magic for spice lovers

,Cooking,"The other day I made Skittles ice cream by melting Skittles in water and making a syrup, which I combined with my custard and churned. The ice cream came out perfect. 

So I figured why not try gummy bears. Melted the gummy bears (1 cup) in 1/4 of water. They melted just fine and I mixed the syrup with my custard and put in the refrigerator to chill just like I did the skittles ice cream. What I failed to think about was the gelatin that is in gummy bears. When I opened my ice cream base this morning, it was gelatinous. So that will not work for the ice cream maker.

Has anyone ever successfully made gummy bear ice cream? If so, how can I prevent the gummy bear syrup from gelatinizing my ice cream base?

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turmeric (हल्दी) - 1/2 tbsp &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coriander Leaves (धनिये के पत्ते) - 10 gm &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cream (मलाई) - 2 tbsp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooking Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Heat the oil (4 Tbsp) in a pot over a high flame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Turn down the heat to medium-low. Add the bay leaves, black pepper, cloves, red chillies, cumin seeds, and mace. Fry the spices for 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Add the chopped onions. Stir fry for 5-6 minutes till golden brown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Now, add the chopped tomatoes, peeled garlic cloves, &amp;amp; chopped ginger. Fry for 4 minutes by stirring frequently at medium-low heat. Turn off the stove, take out the fried mixture in a bowl, let cool for a few minutes, and blend into a smooth paste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Turn on the stove again and heat the oil (4-5 Tbsp) in the same pot. Add the spice paste and stir fry at medium-low heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Next, add the salt, red chilli powder, coriander powder, sugar, lemon water, curd, turmeric powder, fresh coriander leaves, and 1 glass of water (300 ml). Set heat to high and cook by stirring regularly. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. (Add water as per requirement for a thicker/thinner gravy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Uncover and continue cooking the gravy till the water evaporates and oil is released at the edges of the pot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- You may add eggs (boiled &amp;amp; peeled) to this gravy, cook for 2-5 minutes and enjoy a delicious egg curry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- You can fry/boil veggies and add to the gravy for a vegetable curry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- You can transfer the gravy mixture to a pressure cooker, add chicken pieces and cook until 1 whistle for a flavourful chicken curry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- For the mutton curry, put the gravy and mutton pieces in the pressure cooker and cook until 3 whistles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Finish off the gravy by drizzling 1-2 tablespoons of cream for a velvety flavour and rich texture!&lt;/p&gt;

...it's like 99% of the consumer turners out there have a curved front to them.

This drives me *crazy* because it makes them almost impossible to use. Want to spread the melting butter around the pan? Spend a *minute* doing it because only a half-centimeter of the edge is actually making contact. Flipping eggs? Get ready for it to tear. Scraping burnt bits? Same problem with the butter... *back and forth and back and forth for eternity*.

Whereas with a totally straight front, I can spread the butter around in just a couple of seconds. Sliding it under an egg and lifting doesn't run the risk of tearing. Scraping burnt bits takes just a couple of passes.

So I can't figure out for the life of me why manufacturers make *any* spatulas with curved fronts, or why people continue to buy them. And I also can't find any blog post or *anything* comparing the two with pros and cons.

I've heard the theory that the curve of the front of the spatula matche the curve of the edge of the pan, so you can slide the spatula all the way underneath an omelette or something to the very edge. But with the flat spatulas I've owned, that's literally never been an issue.

Am I missing something here? It's like it's one of those things where I feel like the world has gone crazy and I'm the only sane one... is there some advantage to curved edges I'm totally missing?

One can make risotto with almost everything.. But this one is one of my favourite. It tastes spring.

Green peas, parmigiano reggiano, crispy bacon, is a beautiful mix of flavours, colours and textures... it's a very basic risotto. Use your favourite recipe to make it. I give you just a few tricks here...
- use a very dry, almost acidic white wine. You want it to counterbalance the softness of the other ingredients.
- NEVER EVER overcook the arborio rice. 18 min from the moment you pour the white wine to the moment you serve the risotto. Al dente please.
- put the fresh and raw peas just 5 minutes before serving (that's13 min from the beginning if you read me). You want your peas look like spring. Not like smashed overcooked greenish sh....
- dont be shy on butter (50 g per serving is a minimum)
- don't be shy on parmigiano (as much as butter plus a few shaves for serving)
- the risotto must be quite liquid (""al onda"") don't be shy on chicken broth.

Serve with a glass of Meursault.

&lt;p&gt;Green peas, parmigiano reggiano, crispy bacon, is a beautiful mix of flavours, colours and textures... it&amp;#39;s a very basic risotto. Use your favourite recipe to make it. I give you just a few tricks here...
- use a very dry, almost acidic white wine. You want it to counterbalance the softness of the other ingredients.
- NEVER EVER overcook the arborio rice. 18 min from the moment you pour the white wine to the moment you serve the risotto. Al dente please.
- put the fresh and raw peas just 5 minutes before serving (that&amp;#39;s13 min from the beginning if you read me). You want your peas look like spring. Not like smashed overcooked greenish sh....
- dont be shy on butter (50 g per serving is a minimum)
- don&amp;#39;t be shy on parmigiano (as much as butter plus a few shaves for serving)
- the risotto must be quite liquid (&amp;quot;al onda&amp;quot;) don&amp;#39;t be shy on chicken broth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serve with a glass of Meursault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To someone who matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love is a must. Candles are a plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And oh: almost forgot to say... Its gluten free.&lt;/p&gt;

The recipe in the IKEA press release makes 20-24 meatballs and serves 4. I scaled down the recipe to make 10-12 meatballs, serving the two of us :)

For the scaled-down recipe, the ingredients are as follows \[for the full-scale recipe, the measurements will be after the STEPS\]:

For 10-12 meatballs:  
 1. Beef, ground: 250 gm or 1/2 LB \[we used 90/10 ground beef\]   
 2. Pork, ground: 125 gm or 1/4 LB \[we used 80/10\]   
 3. Onion, chopped: 110 gms or half cup \[that is half an onion, medium sized\]   
 4. Garlic, minced: 1 clove   
 5. Breadcrumbs: 50 gm or almost 2 oz   
 6. Egg: 1 whole  
 7. Milk, whole: 2.5 tablespoons   
 8. Salt/Pepper: to taste   
 9. Oil, for frying 

For sauce:   
 1. Butter, unsalted and cold: 20 gms or 1.5 tablespoons   
 2. Flour, AP: 20gms or 1.5 tablespoons   
 3. Stock, Veg + Beef: \[equal quantities of both\] 75ml each OR 5 oz 
 4. Heavy cream: 75 ml or 2.5 oz   
 5. Soy sauce: 1 teaspoon   
 6. Dijon Mustard: 0.5 teaspoon  
 7. Salt, if needed

Steps:  
 1. In a large bowl, mix all the ingredients for the meatballs and make sure they are well combined.  
 2. Make into balls and chill for 2 hours.  
 3. For the sauce, make roux first using butter and flour. For detailed steps of roux making, refer the video, timestamp 02:01.  
 4. Then, add the stock and whisk.  
 5. Add the cream, mustard, and soy sauce. Whisk again. Sauce is ready when it falls into ribbons.  
 6. To fry the meatballs, take some oil in a pan and fry until golden on all side. Finish in the oven @ 350F for 25mins.  
 7. Serve with a side of potatoes. :)

I was thinking of doing a minestrone style soup with this, planning on making a chicken stock in the next few days as a base. I’ve done barley salad before, but we’ve got a few salads on the menu this week. Anything else?

I have a bag of fine polenta and I used it to make cornbread (which I think I need to adjust some ratios/cooking times on) and that was not bad. Was thinking I could try making grits?

I made a pork and black bean stew the other week (attempted feijoada, but apparently not salty enough) and that was pretty good. I was thinking of doing something like black beans with corn and rice, but if there’s any other dishes that make good use of the beans I’d be happy to hear of them.

Learn how to make healthy whole steamed chicken for people of any age group. You can make this chicken recipe for people of any age group and any kind of disease. This is served to Ravi's relative who is 92 years old and has been recommended by doctor also considering his health. All ingredients used here are healthy. Use rock salt (sendha namak) instead of sea salt.   Preparation Time : 15 mins + marination 

Cooking Time : 25 mins 

Servings : 6  

Ingredients :-  

1. 1 Kg Whole Chicken (पूरा मुर्ग) 

2. 4 tbsp Curd (दही) 

3. 1.5 tbsp Ginger Garlic Paste (अदरक लहसुन का पेस्ट) 

4. 1.5 tbsp Lemon Juice (नींबू का रस) 

5. 1 tbsp Papaya Powder (पपीता पाउडर) 

6. 1 tbsp Rock Salt (सेंधा नमक) 

7. 1.5 tbsp Hot Spices Powder (गरम मसाला पाउडर) 

8. 1.5 tbsp Clarified Butter (घी) 

9. 1 tsp Turmeric (हल्दी) 

10. 1/2 tsp Black Pepper Powder (काली मिर्च पाउडर) 

11. 1 Bay Leaf (तेज पत्ता) 

12. 1 Black Cardamom (काली इलाइची) 

13. 1/2 Cinnamon Stick (दालचीनी) 

14. 2 Green Cardamom (हरी इलायची) 

15. 4 Cloves (लौंग) 

16. 4 Black Pepper (काली मिर्च)   


**Cooking Process**

· Begin by washing the whole chicken, pat dry and place it on the chopping board. Using a sharp knife make deep cuts (about 1 - 1.5 inches apart) all over the chicken. Keep aside.

· Next, take a large bowl to prepare the marinade for the chicken. Whisk the fresh curd for a minute and add to the bowl. Add the ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, papaya powder, rock salt, hot spice powder (garam masala), clarified butter/ghee, turmeric powder, &amp; black pepper powder. Mix nicely until all the ingredients are well combined!

· Now, rub the marinade mixture all over the chicken coating it evenly. Make sure to rub the mixture in between the cuts so that the meat absorbs all the flavours. Let it sit for 1 hour on the kitchen top. 

· Place a wide pot on the stove over high heat. Fill ¼ of the pot with water and add a bay leaf, black cardamom, cinnamon stick, green cardamoms, cloves, &amp; black pepper. Bring the water to a boil.

· In the meantime, wrap the marinated chicken (along with the curd mixture) in a large banana leaf and seal it with the help of toothpicks.

· Place the banana wrapped chicken in a slotted steam tray and put the tray on top of the boiling water. Cover with a lid.

· Let the chicken steam-cook for 25-30 minutes. For the first 15 minutes cook on high heat. Then, adjust the heat to medium and cook for the remaining 15 minutes. (\*When cooking with a smaller chicken of 500-600 grams, steam-cook for 20 minutes).

· After 30 minutes, turn off the stove and let the chicken stay covered for 10-15 minutes.

· To serve, uncover the lid, unwrap the banana leaf, and transfer the whole steamed chicken to a serving dish!

&lt;p&gt;· Let the chicken steam-cook for 25-30 minutes. For the first 15 minutes cook on high heat. Then, adjust the heat to medium and cook for the remaining 15 minutes. (*When cooking with a smaller chicken of 500-600 grams, steam-cook for 20 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· After 30 minutes, turn off the stove and let the chicken stay covered for 10-15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· To serve, uncover the lid, unwrap the banana leaf, and transfer the whole steamed chicken to a serving dish! Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

INGREDIENTS:

1 scallion

2 cloves of garlic

(optional) 60 grams of any ham product(I used spam)

1 bowl of rice

80 grams of kimchi

1 medium egg

Recipe:

First mince the garlic and chop the scallions into small parts, cube the ham too if you have it. Turn the stove on medium, then use any neutral oil to fry the garlic until golden brown when it's done add the scallions. After the oil looks brown enough add the ham once the ham looks cooked add the kimchi and stir fry it until everything looks red reduce the heat to low. Fry the egg(sunny side up) in a different pan and put it onto your cutting board. Now dump the rice into the kimchi mixture and stir it together until the rice is combined with the kimchi.

&lt;p&gt;I just put in the amount of seasonings that feels right and it almost always &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; right. Is that weird? Idk, smelling the food always helps too&lt;/p&gt;
